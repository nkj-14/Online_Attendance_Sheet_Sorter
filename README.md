# Online_Attendance_Sheet_Sorter
This is python project, online attendance sheet sorter. As it is useful to take attendance, anyone can just float a form link there and to detect the valid entries which has been made in given timings only and others are invalid so won't count in attendance. We will even consider duplicate entries as invalid and will not count in attendance. Only first unique entry, got in given time, we will count as valid. We will make individual file for an individual's attendance sheet in which we have processed all entries and sorted for the respective which and how many are vali, invalid, duplicates, etc. We will make one consolidated file of the attendace sheet also. The input data will be in .csv file and after processing will get output .xlsx files. Thank you.
